<h1>Issue description</h1>

<p>Form action hijacking vulnerabilities arise when an application places user-supplied input into the action URL of an HTML form. An attacker can use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another application user, will modify the action URL of a form to point to the attacker's server. If a user submits the form then its contents, including any input from the victim user, will be delivered directly to the attacker.</p>
<p> Even if the user doesn't enter any sensitive information, the form may still deliver a valid CSRF token to the attacker, enabling them to perform CSRF attacks. In some cases web browsers may help exacerbate this issue by autocompleting forms with previously entered user input. </p>

<p>Stored form action hijacking vulnerabilities arise when the applicable input was submitted in an previous request and stored by the application.</p>

<h1>Issue remediation</h1>

<p>Consider hard-coding the form action URL, or implementing a whitelist of allowed values.</p>
