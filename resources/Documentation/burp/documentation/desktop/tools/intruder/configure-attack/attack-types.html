<h1 id="burp-intruder-attack-types">Burp Intruder attack types</h1>
<p>
    To determine the way in which payloads are assigned to payload positions, you can specify an attack type. Attack types enable you to configure whether:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Payloads are taken from a single set, or multiple sets (up to 20).
    </li>
    <li>
        Payloads are assigned to payload positions in turn, or simultaneously.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To select an attack type, go to <strong>Intruder &gt; Positions</strong>, and click on the drop-down list under <strong>Choose an attack type</strong>.
</p>
<h2 id="sniper">Sniper</h2>
<p>
    This attack places each payload into each payload position in turn. It uses a single payload set.
</p>
<p>
    The total number of requests generated in the attack is the product of the number of positions and the number of payloads in the payload set.
</p>
<p>
    The Sniper attack is useful for fuzzing a number of request parameters individually for common vulnerabilities.
</p>
<h2 id="battering-ram">Battering ram</h2>
<p>
    This attack places the same payload into all of the defined payload positions simultaneously. It uses a single payload set.
</p>
<p>
    The total number of requests generated in the attack is the number of payloads in the payload set.
</p>
<p>
    The Battering ram attack is useful where an attack requires the same input to be inserted in multiple places within the request. For example, a username within a cookie and a body parameter.
</p>
<h2 id="pitchfork">Pitchfork</h2>
<p>
    This attack iterates through a different payload set for each defined position. Payloads are placed into each position simultaneously. For example, the first three requests would be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request one:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Position 1 = First payload from Set 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position 2 = First payload from Set 2.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request two:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Position 1 = Second payload from Set 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position 2 = Second payload from Set 2.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request three:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Position 1 = Third payload from Set 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position 2 = Third payload from Set 2.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The total number of requests generated in the attack is the number of payloads in the smallest payload set.
</p>
<p>
    The Pitchfork attack is useful where an attack requires different but related input to be inserted in multiple places within the request. For example, to place a username in one parameter, and a known ID number corresponding to that username in another parameter.
</p>
<h2 id="cluster-bomb">Cluster bomb</h2>
<p>
    This attack iterates through a different payload set for each defined position. Payloads are placed from each set in turn, so that all payload combinations are tested. For example, the first three requests would be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request one:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Position 1 = First payload from Set 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position 2 = First payload from Set 2.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request two:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Position 1 = First payload from Set 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position 2 = Second payload from Set 2.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Request three:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Position 1 = First payload from Set 1.
            </li>
            <li>
                Position 2 = Third payload from Set 2.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The total number of requests generated in the attack is the product of the number of payloads in all defined payload sets - this may be extremely large.
</p>
<p>
    The Cluster bomb attack is useful where an attack requires unrelated or unknown input to be inserted in multiple places within the request. For example, when guessing both a username and password.
