<h1>Configuring an Android device to work with Burp Suite</h1>
<p>
    You can configure an Android device to proxy HTTP traffic through Burp Suite. This enables you to test Android apps just like ordinary websites.
</p>
<p>
    The process for doing this varies depending on the device or emulator you're using, as well as your Android OS version. We've provided high-level instructions below, but you may need to find external resources for details on how to perform some of the necessary steps in your environment.
</p>
<div class="highlightedarea">
    <h4>Warning</h4>
    <p>
        From Android 7 (Nougat) onwards, you need to use a rooted device to perform some of these steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rooting your device fundamentally compromises its security model, which may expose you to malware and other forms of attack. It may also void the manufacturer's warranty. Make sure you fully understand the security implications before performing any part of this process.
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="step-1-configure-a-dedicated-proxy-listener-in-burp" cms-ignore-validation="HEADING_CAPITALIZATION">Step 1: Configure a dedicated proxy listener in Burp</h2>
<p>
    To enable Burp to intercept the HTTP traffic generated by your Android device, you need to configure a proxy listener and bind it to an open port.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In Burp, open the <strong>Settings</strong> dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to <strong>Tools &gt; Proxy</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Under <strong>Proxy Listeners</strong>, click <strong>Add</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        On the <strong>Binding</strong> tab, set <strong>Bind to port</strong> to any available port.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set <strong>Bind to address</strong> to <strong>All interfaces</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click <strong>OK</strong> and confirm your entries when prompted.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Burp is now ready to receive HTTP traffic on the assigned port and forward it to the target web server.
</p>
<h2 id="step-2-configure-your-device-to-proxy-traffic-through-burp" cms-ignore-validation="HEADING_CAPITALIZATION">Step 2: Configure your device to proxy traffic through Burp</h2>
<div class="highlightedarea">
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>
        If you're using an Android emulator rather than a physical device, you may need to add the proxy details from the emulator settings menu rather than the native network or Wi-Fi settings on the emulated device.
    </p>
</div>
<ol>
    <li>
        On your Android device, go to the network and internet settings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the network details for the Wi-Fi network that you want to use for testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter edit mode.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the advanced settings, choose the option to configure a proxy manually.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the <strong>Proxy hostname</strong> to the IP address of the machine you're using to run Burp.
    </li>
    <li>
        Set the <strong>Proxy port</strong> to the port you assigned to the new proxy listener you configured in Burp. For more information, see <a href="#step-1-configure-a-dedicated-proxy-listener-in-burp">Configure a dedicated proxy listener in Burp</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Save your changes and then connect to the Wi-Fi network. Your device's web traffic is now proxied through Burp.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="step-3-add-burp-s-ca-certificate-to-your-device-s-trust-store" cms-ignore-validation="HEADING_CAPITALIZATION">Step 3: Add Burp's CA certificate to your device's trust store</h2>
<p>
    Each installation of Burp has its own built-in certificate authority (CA). To work with any HTTPS traffic in Burp, you need to add the associated CA certificate to your device's trust store. This enables Burp to impersonate the target web server during the TLS handshake. As a result, you can read and modify your HTTPS traffic in Burp just like you would with unencrypted HTTP traffic.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In Burp, open the <strong>Settings</strong> dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to <strong>Tools &gt; Proxy</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Under <strong>Proxy Listeners</strong>, click <strong>Import / export CA certificate</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        In <strong>CA Certificate</strong> dialog, select <strong>Export &gt; Certificate in DER format</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter a filename and location for the certificate. Note that you need to explicitly include the <code>.der</code> file extension.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click <strong>Next</strong>. The dialog indicates that the certificate was successfully exported.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the certificate to your device's trust store. The process for doing this varies depending on the device or emulator you're using, as well your Android OS version. You can find detailed, third-party instructions on how to do this online.
    </li>
</ol>
<div class="highlightedarea">
    <h4>Warning</h4>
    <p>
        We've chosen not to document the process of adding the certificate to your device's trust store ourselves. This is partly due to the amount of variation between environments, but also because this requires you to root your device. This undermines both the device's security model and the manufacturer's warranty.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're following a third-party tutorial, please ensure you fully understand the security implications before performing any part of the process. In particular, do not execute any commands that you don't fully understand.
    </p>

<h2 id="step-4-test-the-configuration" cms-ignore-validation="HEADING_CAPITALIZATION, DUPLICATE_HEADINGS">Step 4: Test the configuration</h2>
<p>
    To make sure that you've completed the configuration successfully and are ready to start testing:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        In Burp, go to the <strong>Proxy &gt; Intercept</strong> tab.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the button to turn the <strong>Intercept</strong> feature on.
    </li>
    <li>
        On your Android device, open the browser.
    </li>
    <li>
        Browse to any site using HTTPS. If you've completed the configuration successfully, the page should load without any security warnings and you should see your traffic in Burp on the <strong>Proxy &gt; HTTP history</strong> tab.
    </li>
</ol>
