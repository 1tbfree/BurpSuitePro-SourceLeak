  "description": "<p>\n    Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security mechanism designed to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks by disabling dangerous behaviours such as untrusted JavaScript execution.\n    Websites can specify their security policy in a response header or meta tag, enabling fine-grained control over dangerous features like scripts and stylesheets.\n</p>",
  "remediation": "<p>\n    We recommend that you set the frame-ancestors directive to 'none' if you do not want your site to be framed, or 'self' if you want to allow it to frame itself. In addition,\n    use the X-Frame-Options header with DENY or SAMEORIGIN, based on your needs.\n</p>",
