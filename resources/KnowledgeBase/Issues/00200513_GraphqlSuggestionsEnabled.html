GraphQL suggestions enabled

<h1>Issue description</h1>

<p>GraphQL suggestions are an Apollo feature in which the server is configured to respond to invalid queries with suggestions for valid queries that have a similar syntax.</p>
<p>Suggestions can represent a significant security risk, as they enable attackers to glean information about a GraphQL schema even if introspection is disabled. By sending intentionally invalid queries and collating suggestions in responses, attackers can learn the names and structures of valid queries and mutations.</p>

<h1>Issue remediation</h1>

<p>Ensure that you have disabled or otherwise masked error messages containing suggestions on your GraphQL server.</p>
