<h1>Typical uses for Burp Collaborator</h1>
<p>
    Burp Collaborator can be used to detect a wide range of out-of-band vulnerabilities. Some common use cases are described below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#external-service-interaction">External service interaction</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#out-of-band-resource-load">Out-of-band resource load</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#blind-sql-injection">Blind SQL injection</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#blind-cross-site-scripting">Blind cross-site scripting</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="external-service-interaction">External service interaction</h2>
<p>
    Burp Collaborator can induce and detect a typical external service interaction as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        When the application receives a payload from Burp Collaborator, it performs a DNS lookup on the payload URL, then performs an HTTP request.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Collaborator server receives the DNS lookup and HTTP request.
    </li>
    <li>
        Burp polls the Collaborator server for payload interactions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Burp reports the external service interaction, including the full interaction messages.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    You can detect some types of service vulnerabilities by analyzing the details of the service interaction with a collaborating instance of that service. For example, mail header injection can be detected in this way.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>
        The ability to induce an external service interaction doesn't always indicate a vulnerability. You need to determine whether this is intended behavior. For more information about external service interaction vulnerabilities, see the <strong>External service interaction</strong> issues in <a href="/burp/documentation/scanner/vulnerabilities-list.html">Vulnerabilities detected by Burp Scanner</a>.
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="out-of-band-resource-load">Out-of-band resource load</h2>
<p>
    This is when an application can be induced to load content from an external source and include it in its own response.
</p>
<p>
    To detect this vulnerability, the Collaborator server returns specific data in its responses to the application's interactions. Burp then analyzes the application's in-band response for the data.

    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="blind-sql-injection">Blind SQL injection</h2>
<p>
    This is when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, but its HTTP responses don't contain the results of the relevant SQL query or the details of any database errors.
</p>
<p>
    To detect this vulnerability, Burp sends injection-based payloads that trigger an external interaction when the injection is successful.
</p>
<p>
    The following example uses an Oracle-specific API to trigger an interaction when injected into a SQL statement.

        For more information, see the Web Security Academy documentation on <a href="/web-security/sql-injection/blind/index.html">Blind SQL injection</a>.
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="blind-cross-site-scripting">Blind cross-site scripting</h2>
<p>
    The Collaborator server can notify Burp of deferred interactions that occur asynchronously when the relevant in-band payload is submitted to the target. This enables the detection of various stored vulnerabilities, such as second-order SQL injection and blind XSS.
</p>
<p>
    In the example below:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Burp sends a stored XSS payload that triggers a Collaborator interaction if it is rendered to a user.
    </li>
    <li>
        An admin user views the payload later. Their browser performs the interaction.
    </li>
    <li>
        Burp polls the Collaborator server. Burp receives details of the interaction and reports the stored XSS vulnerability.
    </li>
</ol>
