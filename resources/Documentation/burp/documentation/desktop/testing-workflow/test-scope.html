<h1>Setting the initial test scope in Burp Suite</h1>

    By default, as you use Burp's browser, Burp logs all HTTP or WebSocket messages for further analysis. By setting a scope, you can tell Burp which URLs you want to test and which you don't want to test. For example, you may want to exclude URLs that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You don't have permission to test.
    </li>
    <li>
        Aren't safe to test. For example, URLs that contain potentially dangerous functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Aren't relevant. Once you have set the scope, you can use the filters in the Target site map and Proxy history to screen out some of the noise.
    </li>
</ul>

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>
        In Burp Suite Community Edition, your scope settings are lost when you close Burp, along with any other data. You can save the scope settings as part of a project file in Burp Suite Professional. For more information, see <a href="/burp/documentation/desktop/projects/index.html">Project files</a>.

<h2 id="adding-urls-to-the-scope">Adding URLs to the scope</h2>
<p>
    To add a URL to your scope:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Click <span class="icon-settings"></span><strong>Scope settings</strong> on the lower toolbar to open the <strong>Settings</strong> dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scroll to the <strong>Target scope</strong> setting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Under <strong>Include in scope</strong>, click <strong>Add</strong>. The <strong>Add</strong> prefix for in-scope URLs dialog opens.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter the prefix for the URLs that you want to match, then click <strong>OK</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        When prompted, choose whether to stop logging out-of-scope traffic. This can provide performance benefits.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The prefix is added to the <strong>Include in scope</strong> list. Any URL that starts with this exact prefix is now in scope. Any URL that doesn't start with a prefix from the list is out of scope. For example, if you add <code>https://example.com</code>, requests to any path on this domain are in scope if they're accessed over HTTPS.
</p>
<h2 id="excluding-urls-from-the-scope">Excluding URLs from the scope</h2>
<p>
    After you add a URL to your scope, you may want to exclude specific paths that are a subset of the in-scope prefixes, such as <code>https://example.com/admin</code>. To exclude a URL from your scope:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Click <span class="icon-settings"></span><strong>Scope settings</strong> on the lower toolbar to open the <strong>Settings</strong> dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scroll to the <strong>Target scope</strong> setting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Under <strong>Exclude from scope</strong>, click <strong>Add</strong>. The <strong>Add prefix for out-of-scope URLs</strong> dialog opens.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enter a prefix for the URLs that you want to exclude, then click <strong>OK</strong>.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The prefix is added to the <strong>Exclude from scope</strong> list. A URL is now in scope if it starts with an in-scope prefix, but does not start with an out-of-scope prefix.
