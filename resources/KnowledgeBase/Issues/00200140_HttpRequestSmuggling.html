HTTP request smuggling
<h1>Typical severity</h1>
High
<h1>Issue description</h1>
<p>
    HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise when websites route HTTP requests through web servers with inconsistent HTTP parsing.
</p>
<p>
    By supplying a request that different servers interpret as having different lengths, an attacker can poison the back-end TCP/TLS socket and prepend arbitrary data to the next request. Depending on the website's functionality, this can be used to bypass front-end security rules, access internal systems, poison web caches, and launch assorted attacks on users who are actively browsing the site.
</p>
<h1>Issue remediation</h1>
<p>
    You can resolve all variants of this vulnerability by configuring the front-end server to exclusively use HTTP/2 when communicating with back-end systems. Alternatively, you could ensure all servers in the chain run the same web server software with the same configuration. Disabling back-end connection reuse is likely to reduce the impact of this vulnerability, but does not mitigate all possible exploits.
</p><p>
    Specific instances of this vulnerability can be resolved by reconfiguring the front-end server to normalize ambiguous requests before routing them onward. Alternatively, you could configure the back-end server to reject the message and close the connection when it encounters an ambiguous request.
