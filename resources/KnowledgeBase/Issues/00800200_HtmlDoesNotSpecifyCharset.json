  "name": "HTML does not specify charset",
  "description": "<p>If a  response states that it contains HTML content but does not specify a character set, then the browser may analyze the HTML and attempt to determine which character set it appears to be using. Even if the majority of the HTML actually employs a standard character set such as UTF-8, the presence of non-standard characters anywhere in the response may cause the browser to interpret the content using a different character set. This can have unexpected results, and can lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in which non-standard encodings like UTF-7 can be used to bypass the application's defensive filters.</p>\n<p>In most cases, the absence of a charset directive does not constitute a security flaw, particularly if the response contains static content. You should review the contents of affected responses, and the context in which they appear, to determine whether any vulnerability exists. </p>",
  "remediation": "<p>For every response containing HTML content, the application should include within the Content-type header a directive specifying a standard recognized character set, for example <b>charset=ISO-8859-1</b>.\n</p>",
