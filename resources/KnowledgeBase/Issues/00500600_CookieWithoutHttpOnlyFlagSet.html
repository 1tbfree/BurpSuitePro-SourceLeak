<h1>Issue name</h1>
Cookie without HttpOnly flag set
<h1>Typical severity</h1>

Low

<h1>Issue description</h1>

<p>If the HttpOnly attribute is set on a cookie, then the cookie's value cannot be read or set by client-side JavaScript. This measure makes certain client-side attacks, such as cross-site scripting, slightly harder to exploit by preventing them from trivially capturing the cookie's value via an injected script.</p>

<h1>Issue remediation</h1>

<p>There is usually no good reason not to set the HttpOnly flag on all cookies. Unless you specifically require legitimate client-side scripts within your application to read or set a cookie's value, you should set the HttpOnly flag by including this attribute within the relevant Set-cookie directive.</p>
<p>You should be aware that the restrictions imposed by the HttpOnly flag can potentially be circumvented in some circumstances, and that numerous other serious attacks can be delivered by client-side script injection, aside from simple cookie stealing. </p>
