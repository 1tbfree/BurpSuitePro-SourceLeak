Request URL override
<h1>Typical severity</h1>
Information
<h1>Issue description</h1>
<p>Some applications and frameworks support HTTP headers that can be used to override parts of the request URL, potentially affecting the routing and processing of the request.</p>
<p>Intermediate systems are often oblivious to these headers. In the case of reverse proxies and web application firewalls, this can lead to security rulesets being bypassed. If a caching system is in place, this may enable cache poisoning attacks. These headers may also enable forging of log entries. </p>
<p>Even if the application is intended to be accessed directly, some visitors may be using a corporate proxy enabling localised cache poisoning. </p>
<h1>Issue remediation</h1>
<p>To fully resolve this issue, locate the component that processes the affected headers, and disable it entirely.
If you are using a framework, applying any pending security updates may do this for you.</p>
<p>If this isn't practical, an alternative workaround is to configure an intermediate system to automatically strip the affected headers before they are processed.</p>
