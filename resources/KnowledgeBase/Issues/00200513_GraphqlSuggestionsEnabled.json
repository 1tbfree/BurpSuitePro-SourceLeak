  "description": "<p>GraphQL suggestions are an Apollo feature in which the server is configured to respond to invalid queries with suggestions for valid queries that have a similar syntax.</p>\n<p>Suggestions can represent a significant security risk, as they enable attackers to glean information about a GraphQL schema even if introspection is disabled. By sending intentionally invalid queries and collating suggestions in responses, attackers can learn the names and structures of valid queries and mutations.</p>",
