  "name": "Content security policy: allows form hijacking",
  "description": "<p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security mechanism designed to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks by disabling dangerous behaviours such as untrusted JavaScript execution.\n    Websites can specify their security policy in a response header or meta tag, enabling fine-grained control over dangerous features like scripts and stylesheets.\n</p>",
  "remediation": "<p>We recommend using the form-action directive in the CSP response header to control form post destinations. If no form actions are used, set form-action to 'none' to block\n    untrusted forms. For applications without external form URLs, use 'self' to allow only same-origin URLs. If needed, allow list hosts for external URL form submissions, but\n    be aware this lets attackers submit to these external resources.\n</p>",
