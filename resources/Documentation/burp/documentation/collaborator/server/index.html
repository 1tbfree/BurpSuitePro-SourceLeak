<h1>Burp Collaborator server</h1>
<p>
    Burp Collaborator provides custom implementations of various network services on a single server. The server listens for requests that are induced by Collaborator payloads.
</p>
<p>
    The server has the following functionality:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It is the authoritative DNS server for its registered domains and subdomains. It answers any DNS queries for these domains with its own IP address.
    </li>
    <li>
        It uses a valid wildcard TLS certificate for its domain names.
    </li>
    <li>
        It provides an HTTP/HTTPS service.
    </li>
    <li>
        It provides an SMTP/SMTPS service.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="private-or-public-server">Private or public server</h2>
<p>
    You can choose to use a private or public Collaborator server. The public server is enabled by default.
</p>
<p>
    You can also configure Burp to not use a Collaborator server. With this option, none of the Collaborator capabilities are available. To do this:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <label class="label-edition is-professional">Professional</label>
        In Burp Suite Professional, go to the <strong>Settings</strong> dialog, under <strong>Project &gt; Collaborator</strong>. Select <strong>Don't use Burp Collaborator</strong>. For more information, see <a href="/burp/documentation/desktop/settings/project/collaborator.html">Collaborator settings</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <label class="label-edition is-enterprise">Enterprise</label>
        In Burp Suite Enterprise Edition, do this under <strong>Burp Collaborator server</strong> when you create a custom scan configuration. Select <strong>None</strong> under <strong>Collaborator type</strong>. For more information, see <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/enterprise/user-guide/working-with-sites/site-settings/scan-configurations/custom-configs.html#create-a-custom-scan-configuration">Create a custom scan configuration</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 cms-ignore-validation="DUPLICATE_HEADINGS">Public collaborator server</h3>
<p>
    You can use the server provided by PortSwigger, which is shared between all users. The server is already configured - you can simply start testing.
</p>
<p>
    If the public Collaborator server suffers from a service outage or degradation, then the efficacy of Collaborator-related functionality within Burp may be impaired. For this reason, PortSwigger makes no warranty about the availability or performance of this server.
</p>
<h3>Private Collaborator server</h3>
<p>
    You can choose to run your own instance of the Collaborator server. This requires you to configure the server, but gives you total ownership of your data.
</p>
<p>
    This is likely to appeal to penetration testing firms and in-house security teams. It's also necessary when working on a closed network with no internet access.
</p>
