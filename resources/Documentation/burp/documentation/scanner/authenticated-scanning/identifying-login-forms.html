<h1>Identifying login and registration forms</h1>
<p>
    Burp Scanner's ability to identify login and registration forms is a key part of what makes authenticated scanning in Burp so effective.
</p>
<p>
    When crawling, Burp Scanner first identifies any forms that it believes to be login or registration forms. Any forms meeting all of the following criteria are added to the list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The form is a standard HTML form.
    </li>
    <li>
        The form contains an input field with the attribute <code>type=password</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The password field has a non-empty <code>name</code> attribute.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Burp Scanner then attempts to distinguish registration forms from login forms. To do this, it applies a series of ordered criteria.
</p>
<p>
    The registration form is:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Whichever form has the most password fields.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whichever form has the most text fields.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whichever form has the most multi-value select fields.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whichever form has the most single-value select fields.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whichever form Burp Scanner found first.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    For example, if two forms have an equal number of password fields, Burp Scanner next compares the number of text fields, and so on.
</p>
<h2 id="why-is-burp-scanner-not-filling-in-my-login-forms">Why is Burp Scanner not filling in my login forms?</h2>
<p>
    Burp Scanner identifies login and registration forms based on the password field. However, it only enters a username or email address if the related fields:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Have a <code>type=email</code> or <code>type=text</code> attribute.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have a non-empty <code>name</code> attribute.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the username field does not meet these conditions, then Burp Scanner can identify the form but is unable to enter the corresponding data.
</p>
<h3>What usernames does Burp Scanner submit?</h3>
<p>
    Burp Scanner submits the username as provided in the following situations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The field has a <code>type=text</code> attribute.
    </li>
    <li>
        The field has a <code>type=email</code> attribute and the username provided ends in an email domain.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the field has a <code>type=email</code> attribute but the username provided does not end in an email domain, then Burp Scanner submits the provided username with <code>@burpcollaborator.net</code> appended.
