<h1>Issues</h1>
<p>
    Whenever Burp Scanner identifies a potential vulnerability during auditing, it records this in your project file, along with key information to help you resolve or manually investigate the issue.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose to view either a task-specific list of issues, which contains issues found by an individual task, or a project-level list containing entries for all issues found across all tasks in your project.
</p>
<p>
    To view the project-level issues list:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Go to the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab.
    </li>
    <li>
        From the bottom dock, select <strong>All issues</strong>.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    To view a task-specific issues list:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Go to the <strong>Dashboard</strong> tab.
    </li>
    <li>
        From the <strong>Tasks</strong> list, select the relevant task.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the main panel, go to the <strong>Issues</strong> tab.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    From here, you can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Monitor scan results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review new issues as they are reported.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assign confidence and severity levels to issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Report and delete issues.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each item in the <strong>Issues</strong> table contains the following details:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Time</strong> - The time that the issue was found.
    </li>
