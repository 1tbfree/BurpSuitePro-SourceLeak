  "name": "Json Web Key Set disclosed",
  "description": "<p>\n    A JSON Web Key Set is a JSON object that represents a set of JSON Web Keys (JWKs). Authorization servers often publish JWK Sets under well-known URLs to\n    tell clients how they can verify the signature of issued JWTs. Defined in RFC 7517, this data structure contains cryptographic keys for different signature algorithms,\n    such as HMAC or RSA for example. If a server is configured incorrectly, it may accidentally expose private key components as well as public ones.\n    In this case, a malicious user could use any private keys they've obtained to tamper with the signature of JWT tokens and impersonate other users.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Even if no secret key components are exposed, the knowledge of public keys may be useful for other attacks, such as algorithm and key confusion for example.\n</p>",
  "remediation": "<p>\n    If your JWK Set is exposed publicly, make sure to omit any private key components. As long as it only contains public key components, exposing a JWK Set\n    is not a security threat in itself. In fact, its correct use can represent good practice for non-security reasons.\n</p>",
