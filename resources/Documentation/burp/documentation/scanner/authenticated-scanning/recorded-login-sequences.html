<h1>Recorded login sequences</h1>
<p>
    When configuring application logins for a scan, you can import a recorded login sequence rather than supplying basic user credentials. A recorded login sequence is a set of instructions that tell Burp Scanner how to log in to the website.
</p>
<p>
    Recorded login sequences enable Burp to handle complex authentication mechanisms, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Single sign-on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Multi-step logins in which the username and password are not entered in the same form.
    </li>
    <li>
        Login forms that contain, for example, extra fields or checkboxes.
    </li>
</ul>
<div class="highlightedarea">
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>
        When running a recorded login sequence, Burp Scanner can temporarily follow any out-of-scope links that are necessary to perform the login sequence. However, these locations are not crawled or audited as part of the scan.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Recorded login sequences are especially useful if you are using Burp Suite Enterprise Edition to automate scanning across a large application portfolio. In this case, you may be able to record an application's login sequence once and re-use it multiple times.

<p>
    To record your login sequences, use the Burp Suite Navigation Recorder. This Chrome extension captures your interactions with the website while you perform the login sequence manually. It then generates a JSON-based "script" that you can import into Burp Suite Professional or Burp Suite Enterprise Edition.
</p>

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>
        We recommend that you read the <a href="/burp/documentation/scanner/authenticated-scanning/recorded-login-best-practice.html">Best practice for recording login sequences</a> documentation before attempting to record a login sequence. This page contains advice that should help you to record login sequences that work first time.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    The next time Burp Scanner performs an authenticated crawl, it opens a new browser session and uses this script to perform the full login sequence.
